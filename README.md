# ROB

Visualiser and API for our robotics project

## Steps

Everything you need to know is written in the main.js-file
## Quick guide (OUTDATED):
### #1 Open two terminals
### #2 In the first terminal run "npm run dev"
This will open the canvas with some example data
### #3 In the other terminal run "node .\javascript\api.js"
This will run the API, which is now listening to the port 3000
### #4 Set two browser windows: the "canvas" and blank at the "http://localhost:3000/addRandom"
Refresh the latter one couple of times and enjoy the show on the former!

## Quicker guide:
### #1 Run 'npm run marathon' in your terminal
Will open two shells, open the link provided in one of them.
### #2 Enjoy!
Go to "http://localhost:3000/addRandom" and refresh it a couple of times, so there will be data to draw.
